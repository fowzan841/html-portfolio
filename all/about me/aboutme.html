<p>The most common thing we get asked for is resume help. We are happy to check (and recheck) your resume for free. However, please read through this first so it’s in the best shape it can be. If we see these errors, we are just going to redirect you here. If you don’t have these errors, send it to us in a Google doc, so we can redline it and add comments for you.

    We will help you edit your resumes until they’re perfect, but we’re trying to teach you how to do this yourself, not just do it for you. We don’t think you should have someone else write your resume for you because a resume is just an extension of your personality and should highlight the experiences you value. A great place to start is Microsoft Word, which has some pretty good templates. We’ve also included some templates on this page to help you out.
